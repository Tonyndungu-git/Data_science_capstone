# Data_science_capstone
Spacey is a company looking to know whether
a stage 1 rocket propulsion system can be salvaged after a launch using data from spacex.
This is part of my final project in the IBM Data Science Certificate.
Files are in jupyter notebook starting from how i got the data, to what 
type of model i used and evaluation of the results.
